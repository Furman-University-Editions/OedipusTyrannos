## Details

I made this both to serve as a text for an upper-level Greek class at Furman, in Spring of 2020, and as a test-bed for developing some generic tools and frameworks for the [CITE Arcitecture](http://cite-architecture.org), and for solving some problems with canonically citable texts of drama. A blog post or article describing the details will be forthcoming. — CWB 1/3/2020.
